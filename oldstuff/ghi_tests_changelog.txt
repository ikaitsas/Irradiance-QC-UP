ghi_tests_20221024:
	-Datetime importation to df (where cosZ, Z are caculated) is done from a date_range(..) now (was done from data_file before)
	 This was done to avoid NaN values for Z during timezone shift, if there where missing datetimes in data_file 
	-Added some extra commands useful (for me) for testing (finding duplicate values/counts, missing minute/value counts in a day etc.)
	-Added some to do things
